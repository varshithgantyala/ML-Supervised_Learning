# Simple Linear Regression: Predicting Home Prices

## Description

This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model built to predict home prices based on a single feature (likely the square footage of the area). The model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and uses a sample dataset of home prices.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is contained in the following files:

* `home_prices1.csv`

The primary feature used for prediction is the area of the house, and the target variable is its price.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install notebook pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
